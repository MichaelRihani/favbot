favbot
======

Automatically favorite tweets that contain certain keywords

Start off by installing all the dependencies:

`npm install`

Then add your twitter credentials to settings.js and modify the keywords you'd like to track.
The "delay" variable defines how many seconds to wait before favoriting a tweet after it was
created.

After modifying settings.js, start the script by running

`node favbot`
